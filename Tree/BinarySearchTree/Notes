Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers.

    It is called a binary tree because each tree node has a maximum of two children.
    It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.

The properties that separate a binary search tree from a regular binary tree is

    All nodes of left subtree are less than the root node
    All nodes of right subtree are more than the root node
    Both subtrees of each node are also BSTs i.e. they have the above two properties

Binary Search Tree Applications

    In multilevel indexing in the database
    For dynamic sorting
    For managing virtual memory areas in Unix kernel
