Heap data structure is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property. It is also called as a binary heap.

A complete binary tree is a special binary tree in which
    every level, except possibly the last, is filled
    all the nodes are as far left as possible

Heap Property is the property of a node in which

 (for max heap) key of each node is always greater than its child node/s and the key of the root node is the largest among all other nodes;
 (for min heap) key of each node is always smaller than the child node/s and the key of the root node is the smallest among all other nodes.

 Heapify

 Heapify is the process of creating a heap data structure from a binary tree. It is used to create a Min-Heap or a Max-Heap.

 Heap Data Structure Applications

     Heap is used while implementing a priority queue.
     Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm
     Heap Sort
