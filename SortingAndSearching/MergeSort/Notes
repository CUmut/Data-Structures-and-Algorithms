Merge Sort is one of the most popular sorting algorithms that is based on the principle of Divide and Conquer Algorithm.

Here, a problem is divided into multiple sub-problems. Each sub-problem is solved individually.
Finally, sub-problems are combined to form the final solution.

The SortingAndSearching.MergeSort function repeatedly divides the array into two halves until we reach a stage where we try to perform SortingAndSearching.MergeSort on a subarray of size 1 i.e. p == r.
After that, the merge function comes into play and combines the sorted arrays into larger arrays until the whole array is merged.
